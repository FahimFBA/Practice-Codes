2. Create an Employee record system for a company. The application will help the company to view the 
record of a specific employee (given id), update the employee’s info and get the employee’s current 
salary. (Use an array to store different types of employee objects. Subclass polymorphism should be 
used)
The Company has 3 types of employee (Salaried, HourlySalaried, Commissioned), your application must 
handle all types of employees.





Note: 
1. Salaried Employee: Salary given at the end of each month. 

2. HourlySalaried Employee: Salary calculated as: Salary per hour * No of hours worked. 

3. Commissoned Employee: Has a base salary + commission for each product sold.
